Implement a simple class that wraps the 3d engine
add some methods to interact with it and create some basic particles + constraints.

make that particle information accessible for rendering with a multimesh in godot.

MultiMeshInstance to contain the meshes, then pass the transform data over to godot
Create a PoolRealArray to contain the tranform data.

Transform3D is 12 floats, no custom data or color needed.
Each instance will have the same orientation, but a different scale and position.
Transform is a 3x4 matrix, column major order, this makes it easy to setup.

Engine node will be setup, the scene will pass the mesh instance to it.
Then the scene will call methods on the Engine node to create particles and instances, as well as constraints.
The physics will be updated once per cycle of the physics process in godot
